# Sokoban Game

This project has been programmed as a version of the classic Sokoban game. The game consists of the character's communication with objects in predefined locations on a map. These objects are walls, boxes, and endpoints. While characters and boxes are moving, endpoints and walls are fixed. Character and boxes, which are moving objects, cannot exceed wall objects. The character object is managed by the user with the arrow (direction) keys. Box objects can move in the direction indicated by the character when it comes into contact with the character object. The general purpose of the game is to move the box objects to the end point by moving the character with the arrow (direction) keys. The section is considered finished when all the boxes are at the end point. When one of the boxes reaches the blind spot, the character cannot make a move that can bring the box to the end point. In this case, the section must be restarted because the puzzle cannot be solved. Although there is only one chapter in the game, it can be easily improved by adding new levels.
